# QR Code Phishing Detector 🛡️📱

A simple, browser‑based tool that scans QR codes, extracts the embedded URL, and checks it for common phishing indicators.  
Designed to help users stay safe from modern “quishing” attacks.

## Why This Project Matters

QR‑based phishing is becoming increasingly common in workplaces, public spaces, and even emails.  
Attackers use QR codes to hide malicious URLs behind something that looks harmless.

This tool helps users:
- decode QR codes safely
- understand what the link actually is
- spot red flags before scanning with their phone
- build awareness of modern phishing tactics

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – structure and layout  
- **CSS3** – clean, accessible UI  
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)** – QR decoding + phishing analysis  
- **GitHub Pages** – hosting and deployment  

## Key Features (Planned)

- Upload a QR code image  
- Decode the embedded URL  
- Analyse the URL for phishing indicators  
- Provide a clear risk score (Safe / Suspicious / Dangerous)  
- Explain red flags in plain language  

## Project Status

🚧 **Work in progress — Step 1 complete.**  
More features will be added step‑by‑step.
